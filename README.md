# Predicting Early Diabetes

Welcome to the "Predicting Early Diabetes" project repository. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the onset of diabetes in individuals at 
an early stage. Early detection can be crucial for effective disease management and prevention.

## Project Overview

- Python-based project for predicting early diabetes using machine learning.
- Comparison of multiple machine learning models to identify the most effective predictor.
- Exploration of relevant datasets and data preprocessing techniques.
- Evaluation of model performance using various metrics.
